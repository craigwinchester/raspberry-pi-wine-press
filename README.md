My first project. Please excuse the sloppy coding... and ramblings...

This project runs a raspberry pi to control a pnumatic wine bladder press.  
I started this project for an older model (1990's) bladder press that used mechanical timers and pressure sensors to run it's press cycles.  These parts are very hard to find!! 
So why not just use a Raspberry Pi and some other more modern parts to get this thing running again.

It's a work in progress.  I have not yet connected it to the press.... that comes later.  This was started as a "pandemic" project back in 2020, and much of the code was finished then. Im back now trying to finish this thing.

First you need some parts.

Raspberry Pi - im using a model 3 for testing. will probably update it to a 4 or 5.
    
Pressure Transducer Sensor -  There are many options.  A 3 wire -1 to 3 Bar 4-20mA.  
I am currently testing with one from Amazon.  https://shorturl.at/Mhv85.  There are probably better ones. So far this is good for testing.
        
Arduino Uno - to connect the pressure sensor. 
    
Relay Expansion Module for Raspberry Pi - Im using an 8 relay module.  https://www.pishop.us/product/8-channel-relay-module-for-arduino-raspberry-pi-5v/
    
TouchScreen - cheap 7 inch.  Not really needed for testing... but nice.

Thats all I have for you right now... I will be back.

Arduino sketch code added - Pretty sure this works.  Got this from here: https://forum.arduino.cc/t/newbie-1st-project-will-this-work/897563/9
Once you get the Arduino setup. You can use the ArduinoTest1.py to see if it works.
